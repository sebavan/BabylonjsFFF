## Running locally

After cloning the repo, running locally during development is all the simplest:
```
npm install
npm start
```

For VSCode users, if you have installed the Chrome Debugging extension, you can start debugging within VSCode by using the appropriate launch menu.

## What is this about ?

The project is trying to demonstrate how to minimize both time to first displayed frame as well as cpu usage during simple rendering of a multipass effect.
